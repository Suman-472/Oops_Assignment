        "## The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
        "     # 1. Classes and Objects:\n",
        "            # Class: A blueprint for creating objects. It defines a type of object according to the attributes and methods that the objects created from the class will have.\n",
        "            # Object: An instance of a class. It represents a specific entity with defined attributes and behaviors.\n",
        "     # 2. Inheritance:\n",
        "            # This allows a new class to inherit the properties and methods of an existing class. It promotes code reusability and establishes a natural hierarchy between classes.\n",
        "     # 3. Abstraction:\n",
        "            # This concept involves hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object. It helps in reducing programming complexity and effort.\n",
        "     # 4. Polymorphism:\n",
        "            # This allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class.\n",
        "            # The most common use of polymorphism is when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.It enables one interface to be used for a general class of actions.\n",
        "     # 5. Encapsulation:\n",
        "            # This concept involves bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class.\n",
        "            # It also restricts direct access to some of the object’s components, which is a means of preventing accidental interference and misuse of the data."
